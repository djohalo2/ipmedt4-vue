# IPMEDT4 Project

> A mobile/web application built for a school project. The goal of the project is to improve the process of breaking a leg from the moment it happens to being completely cured. For this project we decided to build an app in which information, exercises, medicine use and a personal dossier is given to the patient.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ quasar dev

# build for production with minification
$ quasar build

# lint code
$ quasar lint
```
